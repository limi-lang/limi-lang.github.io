# Introduction

Limi is a multi-paradigm functional-logic language. It is designed to be an un-versioned interface between a programmer and a computer. It default operational semantics are based on lazy needed narrowing and residuation.

Limi abstracts over persistent file storage and the network just like current languages abstract over access to main memory

The language is still in development
