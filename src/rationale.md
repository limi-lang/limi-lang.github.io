# Rationale

Software systems currently have systemic problems. These problems are endemic to the industry and exist due to the architecture of the tools and processes used to design software systems.
These problems include; 

- Software Security
- Software Complexity
- Software Compartibility / Interoperability
- Dependency Hell
- Abstraction Hell
- State Management
- Software bloat and duplication
- Technical debt
- Poor abstractions / Abstraction abuse
- Losing the forest for the trees
- Change fatigue
- Obsolescence
- Failure to separate concerns
- Backwards compartibility
- Abstraction leakage ( control transfer is a low level concern)
- Lost productivity in learning exercises
- Smallest unit of production code

Needs a mathematically modelled solution. Access to IO, Process Modelling
Some solutions are bolten on
Software errors are very expensive. ( Solution Mathematical rigor ), we should treat  a software package as rigorously as a mathematical theorem

Limi is a multi-paradigm programming system. It is more than a language. 
Mathematicians admit that there is no known solution to an open problem. Business people make it work
